## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

There is more to a job search than code!  During this lab, you'll get practice answering interview questions unrelated to your coding capabilities, questions that are __really__ important to a company's overall evaluation of a candidate.

## Exercise

This lab is split into two sessions:

#### Part 1 (1:25)

- The class will be split in half:
  - One half of the class should leave the room, work on their final projects, and return in an hour and 25 minutes
  - The other half of the class should form two groups; one instructional team member should join each group

- Then, the instructional team member in each group will lead an activity where he or she introduces behavioral interviews and why they are important

- After, the instructional team member will choose one interview question from the list below and ask that same question to each student in the group, one after another; each student should get 2-3 minutes to answer the question

- After all students in the group have answered the question, the instructor should lead a discussion around student answers:
  - How did that go?
  - What was your favorite answer?
  - Which answer could use some work? Why?

- The instructor should then provide some general feedback on the best ways to answer that question, based on their personal experience

- Choose a new question and repeat!

- Keep repeating until time is up - try to get through as many questions as possible

#### Part 2 (1:25)

- The other half of the class should return to the room; follow the same activity from part 1 for this half of the class

#### Questions

- Tell me a about a time you were given critical feedback (about your design/code). How did you change/improve/respond to that situation?
- Tell me about a time you worked together as a group to complete a project. What role did you play in the group?
- What are your top principles when working together with a team?
- What do you think is important to be a successful #{fill in a role} for #{fill in a company name}?
- Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do and you were required to prioritize your tasks.
- Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem.
- Give me a specific example of a time when you used good judgment and logic in solving a problem.
- Tell me about a time that you helped/mentored/taught someone a difficult concept. What did you like about it? What was challenging?
- How do you give critical feedback?  What does that look like?
- How you you describe your communication style?  What do you feel resembles good communication?
- Please tell me your favorite super hero and why.  Or, please tell me your top three shows and why.


> Instructor Note: Feel free to add more!  Use your experience in interview settings and your best judgement to provide feedback and evaluate student answers as a group.
