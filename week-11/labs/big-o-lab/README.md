## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

#### What we are doing

In this lab, you will be identifying the type of sort and calculating Big O (worst case performance) of various sorting algorithms.

#### Why we are doing it

Big-O notation is a core computer science concept. Using it allows you to compare different algorithms with one another and to asses which algorithms are practical and which are not.

You are also learning it because you will be asked about it during job interviews ðŸ˜‰.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

+ Identify the type of sort for three pseudocoded algorithms
+ Calculate the Big O notation of those algorithms
+ Include **an explanation** for each calculation

#### Starter Code

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find code for the three pseudocoded algorithms and the bonus.

#### Solution Code
Solution code can be found in the [solution-code](solution-code) folder.

#### Deliverable

Below each method, write the type of sort, the Big O notation, and an explanation for how you came to that conclusion.

Submit a pull request with your `pseudocode.txt` file that all of the information above for each algorithm.

### Bonus Activities

+ Complete the fourth algorithm

+ Write at least one of the algorithms in Swift, in a Playgrounds file
