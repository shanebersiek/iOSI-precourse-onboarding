## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

There are lots of interviews that ask candidates to apply programming knowledge from a whiteboard or Android Studio.  During this lab, you'll get practice answering interview questions you would typically hear on a phone interview, often one of the first steps in the interview process.

## Exercise

This lab is split into two sessions:

#### Part 1 (1:25)

- The class will be split in half:
  - One half of the class should leave the room, work on their final projects, and return in an hour and 25 minutes
  - The other half of the class should form two groups; one instructional team member should join each group

- Then, the instructional team member in each group will lead an activity where he or she introduces phone interviews and why they are important

- After, the instructional team member will choose one interview question from the list below and ask that same question to each student in the group, one after another; each student should get 2-3 minutes to answer the question

- After all students in the group have answered the question, the instructor should lead a discussion around student answers:
  - How did that go?
  - What was your favorite answer?
  - Which answer could use some work? Why?

- The instructor should then provide some general feedback on the best ways to answer that question, based on their personal experience

- Choose a new question and repeat!

- Keep repeating until time is up - try to get through as many questions as possible

#### Part 2 (1:25)

- The other half of the class should return to the room; follow the same activity from part 1 for this half of the class

#### Questions

- Describe a time where you had difficulty implementing something in Android.
- What is the difference between an Activity and a Fragment?
- Explain how a ListView recycles views.
- Name some layouts you know, and tell what makes them unique.
- Explain the purpose/benefits of RecyclerView.
- What is the main caveat of using a Service?
- When is onPause() called?
- What are the problems with AsyncTask?
- Tell me about the Activity LifeCycle.



> Instructor Note: Feel free to add more!  Use your experience in interview settings and your best judgement to provide feedback and evaluate student answers as a group.
