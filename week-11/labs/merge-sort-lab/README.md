## Introduction

#### What we are doing

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be completed in small groups of 2-3._

This lab will help you gain more practice using Merge Sort.


#### Why we are doing it

 The principles behind Merge Sort are basic and every programmer should understand them.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

This lab will be split up into two sections: practice and interview.  Take turns playing the interviewer and interviewee for each of the arrays provided - partner 1 should be the interviewee for arrays 1, 3, 5 and partner two for 2, 4, 6.

**Practice**

There are 6 arrays listed below. For each one, on the wall or on the desk, draw out the Merge Sort diagram, showing each step of your process as you split up the array - also, include the steps needed to merge everything back together.

- [-5,20,3,2,22]

- [4,-4,3,-3,1,0]

- [-3,1,0,0,5,2]

- [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

- [1,-5,77,28,15,91,-8,23,52,44,140,14,23,41]

- [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]

**Interview**

One person will play the interviewee, and the others will play the interviewer(s). The interviewers will give the interviewee an array of numbers, similar to the arrays above. The interviewee has ~10 minutes to sort the numbers via Merge Sort. After ~10 minutes, students should swap roles. Repeat until everyone has gone.


#### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Solution Code

There is no solution code for this lab.

## Deliverables

Take pictures of the diagram for each practice problem and include those pictures are part of a pull submitted pull request to this repository. Nothing to submit for the interview section.
