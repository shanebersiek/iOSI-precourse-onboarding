> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you will have additional practice identifying the Big-O runtime of sample blocks of code.

#### Requirements

- Identify the big-o complexity of the 5 code samples given by leaving a comment above them

**Bonus:**

- Given an algorithm that runs in O(n^2), figure out how to make it run in O(nlogn) in the manner of your choosing.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](/starter-code). This consists of a playground with several functions containing blocks of code. Your task is to identify the big-o complexity of each of these functions by leaving a comment in the code above them. Example:

```
var map: [String: String] = ["hi": "there!"]

// The below block runs in O(1)
map["hey"] = "there!"

```

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the playground in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

Your edited playground should meet all of the specifications above. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code (once posted).
