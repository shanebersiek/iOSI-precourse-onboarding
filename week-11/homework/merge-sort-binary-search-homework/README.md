> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you should be able to implement several algorithms given a plain-text description of them and a skeleton playground file.

#### Requirements

- Implement binary search through an array of integers
- Implement merge sorting through an array of integers

**Bonus:**

- Change your implementations to be generic and work with any generic Comparable content type. See [this](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html) for more details on Generics.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](/starter-code). This consists of a playground with several empty functions to be implemented. Descriptions of the merge sort and binary search are provided. Your task is to implement both mergesort and binary search as described.

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the playground in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

Your edited playground should meet all of the specifications above and pass the included unit tests in the playground file. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code (once posted).
