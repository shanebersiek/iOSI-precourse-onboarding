## Introduction


It's time to begin to prioritize your features for your final project!

## Exercise

#### Part 1: Requirements (45 mins)

- Review your personas, user goals, and flows. You probably want to identify ~2 more user goals in addition to the primary happy path we worked on
- List out all the features that would make these goals possible
- Prioritize using a 2x2 matrix and use the prioritization results to help you decide which features make the most sense for your user goals
- Make sure you document your work by taking a photo - you'll need this for to submit as a deliverable

> Instructor Note: Instructional staff should circulate around the room and help students as needed.

#### Part 2: Requirements (1:15)

Create a deck that outlines your vision for your final project. How can you meet user needs while also providing a unique vision, based on what users value and whatâ€™s happening in the competitive space?

Take one hour and 15 minutes to create a project proposal that answers the following questions:

- What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?
- What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned
- Who is your target audience?
- What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.
- How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?
- Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)

Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much insider terminology.  

Be sure to tap into your work from this week - research plan, personas, prioritization, etc.

#### Part 3: Present (1:00+)

> Instructor note: This section has the potential to go way over.  Be mindful of the time limit for each student. Students who aren't presenting can feel free to begin drafting their backlog of user stories.

Now, students will present their project proposal decks to one member of the instructional teams using their laptops (not in front of the class). The instructional team can sit with students 1:1 in class or find places around campus to have students present to them 1:1.

Instructional team should split up the class evenly (for a class with 24 students and three instructional members, each instructor should take 8 students). Instructors should also take notes about what they liked and what could be improved and share these notes with students; students should use the instructors notes to iterate on their vision over the weekend and begin drafting user stories. 


#### Deliverable

Create a presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 6 slides that answers the questions above. Include images, if appropriate.

By the end of this week, you should submit a pull request for your final project with all of your research work; included in that pull request should be the deliverables (or proof of the deliverables) from this lab included in or linked to in your final project's readme file - read more about project 4's deliverable schedule [here](../../projects/project-04).
