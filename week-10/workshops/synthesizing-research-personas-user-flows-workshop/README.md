## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Now, it's time to create personas, a problem statement, and sketch out some user flows for your final project - take the research from your homework interviews, affinity map and build personas using new [Personas Worksheets](assets/personas-worksheet.ai).

## Exercise

#### Part 1: Synthesize your research (1:30)

Start synthesizing your research homework and affinity map your observations. Use the [Research Highlights Worksheet](assets/research-highlights-worksheet.ai) to help guide you. Some helpful hints:

- Don’t forget to add headings to each grouping
- Take a photo of the results to document your findings - you'll need this later!
- If you have not finished interviewing, try to interview people from class or around campus; take the Post­-its home and re-­synthesize with the new information later

Once you’ve finished synthesizing your research interviews, move on to creating however many personas were indicated by your results. Persona(s) will need to be completed as a deliverable of the final project.

#### Part 2: Create a problem statement (45 mins)

Use the [Problem Statement Worksheet](assets/problem-statement-worksheet.pdf) and try writing a "How Might We" statement for your final project using the results from your user interviews.

Make sure you try writing a few and adjusting its level of specificity for the problem you’re facing.

> Instructor note: Instructional team should circulate through the room and help students. They may need to be nudged to look beyond the obvious or helped to further distill the question.

Go back to the Problem Statement Worksheet and try filling out the basic format problem statement for your final project. Build off of the ideas from your "How Might We" worksheet.

Then, try filling in your hypothesis.

> Instructor Note: Instructional team should circulate through the room and help students; some will have issues with phrasing.

#### Part 3: Create a user flow (45 mins)

How are you going to get your persona to complete their primary user goal? Create a few storyboards using the [Storyboard Worksheet](assets/storyboard-worksheet.pdf) as a starting point to help you document the overall flow.

#### Starter assets

Be sure to grab and print the [Personas Worksheet](assets/personas-worksheet.ai), the [Problem Statement Worksheet](assets/problem-statement-worksheet.pdf),  the [Storyboard Worksheet](assets/storyboard-worksheet.pdf), and the [Research Highlights Worksheet](assets/research-highlights-worksheet.ai) from the assets folder to start working.

#### Deliverable

By the end of this week, you should submit a pull request for your final project with all of your research work; included in that pull request should be the deliverables (or proof of the deliverables) from this lab included in or linked to in your final project's readme file - read more about project 4's deliverable schedule [here](../../projects/project-04).
