## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will prepare an app for App Store publication.

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be done independently._


#### Why we are doing it

When developing for iOS, going through the App Store is a necessity. Familiarizing yourself with the app submission process will save you time and frustration in the future, when career-important apps need to be submitted and approved in a timely fashion.

## Exercise

### Requirements

+ Register your app ID on iTunes Connect
+ Add your app to your list of apps in iTunes Connect
+ Prepare app icon images for all supported devices in Xcode
+ In Xcode, archive your app
+ In Xcode, upload the archive to the App Store
+ In iTunes Connect, begin Internal Testing with TestFlight
+ Add classmates to your list of testers and distribute the build to them
+ Gather feedback from your testers about your app
+ Your app must be registered with your developer account on iTunes Connect
+ Your app must be in testing with TestFlight

### Starter code

Use your own project for this lab.

### Solution Code

An example of an app prepared for upload can be found in [solution-code](solution-code).

## Deliverables

Turn in a screenshot of your iTunes Connect internal testing page, a list of who tested your app, and your notes regarding their feedback.


**Verify that**
+ Your app is properly listed on iTunes Connect
