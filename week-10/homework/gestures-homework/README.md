> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you should be able to add advanced gesture functionality to an existing app using gesture recognizers. You should be able to respond to events upon a gesture happening, and also respond to changes of a gesture in progress.

#### Requirements

- Given an image viewer app that views one image, add the ability to tap on that image to see it 'selected' (by adding a border width and color) and 'unselected' (by removing the border width and color)
- Add the ability to pinch on the image. When the pinch is in progress, the image should move with the pinch (i.e. it should rotate and zoom with your moving fingers. If your fingers move in clockwise motion, the image should move in a clockwise motion. If your fingers pinch to zoom, the image should pinch to zoom. If your fingers are moving in a clockwise motion while pinching to zoom, the image should follow suit.)

**Bonus:**

- Implement your own gesture recognizer, the three-finger tap, to make the image move 'crazily'. The definition of 'crazily' is up to you, get creative!

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](/starter-code). This consists of an application as described above. Your task is to add gesture functionality to the app.

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the project in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

Your edited project should meet all of the specifications described, and [will be evaluated by the following rubric](/rubric.md). Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code (once posted).
