> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to create an instance of an object, access its properties and class methods, and define your own classes.

#### Requirements

* Create a simple instance of a pre-defined object, set a property on it, then print it. You should then be able to use a static method on a class to configure the object.
* Create a class of their own with a set of properties, create an instance of that class, then print it.

**Bonus:**

- Create a 'struct' with the same properties as the class. Write a few lines of code that demonstrates the differences between 'pass by reference' objects and 'pass by value' structs.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](starter-code/).

To get the assignment, you will need to fork the iOSI-course-materials repository and download it. Do your work on your own fork, commit and push it, then create a pull request using the Github website for your final submission back to the original iOSI-course-materials repo.

> Note: Here is the [solution code](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iOSI-course-materials/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-02/baseline-materials/object-oriented-programming-homework/solution-code).

#### Deliverable

At the bottom of the file are unit tests. For your homework to succeed, all tests must pass.

#### Assessment

Open the playground file and follow instructions. The file includes a unit test that will automatically check to see if you got the right answers! Having trouble? Try revising your code. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code.

> Instructors: The playground file includes a unit test that will automatically check student input. If you want to further confirm their progress before their final submission, you could ask them to submit a PR with their modified playground file.
