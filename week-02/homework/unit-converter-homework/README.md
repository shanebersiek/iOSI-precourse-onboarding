> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this exercise, you should have end-to-end experience building your own simple app. The app is an "Emoji converter", built with storyboards, that converts plaintext words (of your choice) to emojis.

#### Requirements

- The app should have one text input field (for text), one label (to display the result), and one button (to translate the text into the result)
- When the button is pressed, the contents of the label should be translated from plain text to the appropriate emoji (e.g. 'Happy' -> 😀, 'Beyonce' -> 🐝) and displayed on the label. You should have at least 10 different translations, of your own choosing.
- There should be a 'not found' state if the user enters text that does not have a corresponding emoji associated with it.

**Bonus:**

- The text input field should automatically display the appropriate emoji for the input text without the need to click on the 'translate' button.

#### Starter code

There is no starter code for this assignment. Create a project in this folder by navigating to Xcode, choosing File -> New -> Project, and walking through the wizard to create a new iOS Single-View Application. Name it what you will. You do not need Core Data, Unit Tests or UI Tests.

#### Deliverable

Your deliverable is a complete app hosted in your local repository. When finished, submit a pull request to your course repository.

#### Assessment

The contained app should meet as many of the above specifications as possible. Don't worry about graphics or additional features. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code
