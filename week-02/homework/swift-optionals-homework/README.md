> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

You should be able to create optional values, understand when one might define a variable as optional, and deal with optional values when encountered after completing this homework.

#### Requirements

- Given an optional value, unwrap it using 'if let', then set a value on it using '?'
- Create an optional variable set to nil, set it to something real, then set a property on it using '?'

**Bonus:**
- Unwrap an optional value using 'guard let'

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iOSI-course-materials/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-02/baseline-materials/swift-optionals-homework/starter-code).

To get the assignment, you will need to fork the iOSI-course-materials repository and download it. Do your work on your own fork, commit and push it, then create a pull request using the Github website for your final submission back to the original iOSI-course-materials repo.

> Note: Here is the [solution code](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iOSI-course-materials/tree/master/curriculum/04-schedule-and-supplies/week-02/baseline-materials/swift-optionals-homework/solution-code).

#### Deliverable

At the bottom of the file are unit tests. For your homework to succeed, all tests must pass.

#### Assessment

Open the playground file and follow instructions. The file includes a unit test that will automatically check to see if you got the right answers! Having trouble? Try revising your code. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code.

> Instructors: The playground file includes a unit test that will automatically check student input. If you want to further confirm their progress before their final submission, you could ask them to submit a PR with their modified playground file.
