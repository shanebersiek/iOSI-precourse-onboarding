## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice using Swift Optionals to write safe code in Swift.

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be independently._


#### Why we are doing it

A majority of programming mistakes are related to accessing something that doesn't exist, or `nil`.

Optionals is a key Swift feature that helps prevent app crashes by forcing programmers to check their assumptions at the door.

## Exercise

In this exercise we are going to practice using Swift Optionals to write Safe code, as well as making unsafe code, safe.

### Requirements

Open the [Starter Code](#starter-code) and complete all of the exercises there.

### Starter code

Starter Code can be found in the [starter-code](starter-code) folder.


### Solution Code
Solution code can be found in the [solution-code](solution-code) folder.

## Deliverables

Turn in your code in a single Playgrounds Project.


**Verify that**
+ Your code compiles
+ You have solved the problems listed in a type-safe way
+ You tested your solutions by calling them

### Bonus Activities

Bonus problems can be found in the [starter code](starter-code).
