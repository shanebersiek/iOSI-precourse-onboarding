## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will manipulate strings using built-in methods, mapping, filtering and reducing.

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be done independently._


#### Why we are doing it

The string is a common data type in Swift. One should be able to manipulate strings with ease. Beyond strings, though, developers should also feel comfortable manipulating data with the map, filter and reduce functions. These functions are useful across data types and illustrate the functional programming capabilities of the language.

## Exercise

Create a new Xcode project with unit tests and write a class with methods that make use of map, filter, and reduce.

### Requirements

+ Write a function that takes a string and returns that string with characters in reverse order

+ Write a function that takes a string and returns the same string but with each character preceded by its index from the original

+ Write a function that takes a string and returns an array of the words from that string

+ Write a function that takes a string and returns an array of the words longer than 3 characters from that string

+ Write a function that takes an array of words and returns a string in which the words have been strung together to form a sentence (there should be spaces between the words)

### Starter Code

There is no starter code; create a new project.

### Solution Code

Solution code can be found in [solution-code](solution-code).

## Deliverables

Turn in an XCode Project or Playgrounds.

### Bonus Activities

+ Write a function that checks whether a String is a [palindrome](http://www.palindromelist.net/).
	> A Palindrom is a word or phrase that, when reversed, is the same word. For example, "amore roma" reversed is "amore roma".

+ Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of words in the string
+ Write a function that takes a string and returns the number of sentences
+ Write a function that take a string and returns the average length of words.
