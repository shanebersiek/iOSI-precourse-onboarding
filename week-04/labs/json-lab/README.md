## Introduction

#### What we are doing

> ***Note:*** _This should be done independently._

In this lab, you will be creating JSON files that will provide information about your family members. You will have to create two files that will have the same information about your family members but will have a different structure. After you created the files, go to [JSON Beautifier](http://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer) to validate your JSON syntax.

#### Why are we doing it?  

Data from the web will be in JSON format - you *must* be comfortable working with JSON if you plan to use data from the web.

## Exercise  

#### Requirements

- create a file "family_array" with an array as the root element:

	* it should have as many objects as there are members in your family
	* each member should have four attributes: name, age, quality the member can be best described with and appearance that will be an object itself
	* appearance should have two attributes: eyes (color) and hair (short/long)


- create a file "family_nested_objects" with an array as the root element:

	* it will have as many objects as there are members in your family
	* each nested object should have a name that will be the real person's name
	* each member should have 3 attributes: age, quality the member can be best described with and appearance that will be an object itself
	* appearance should have two attributes: eyes (color) and hair (short/long)

**Bonus**:

- Look up the definition for API and then research APIs for companies/apps you are interested in; finally, look through the documentation to explore the JSON structure they use and what data can be provided

## Deliverables

Submit a pull request with your `.json` files.
