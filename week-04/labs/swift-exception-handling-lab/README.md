## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice error-handling using the Swift `do-try-catch` feature.

> ***Note:*** _This lab should be done independently._


#### Why we are doing it

Straight from the [Swift Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ErrorHandling.html):


> Some operations aren’t guaranteed to always complete execution or produce a useful output. Optionals are used to represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it’s often useful to understand what caused the failure, so that your code can respond accordingly.
>
> As an example, consider the task of reading and processing data from a file on disk. There are a number of ways this task can fail, including the file not existing at the specified path, the file not having read permissions, or the file not being encoded in a compatible format. Distinguishing among these different situations allows a program to resolve some errors and to communicate to the user any errors it can’t resolve.


## Exercise


### Requirements

Open up the `contents.xcplayground` file from the [starter-code](starter-code) and solve the six exercises in that file.

### Starter code

Starter code is available in the [starter-code](starter-code) folder.

### Solution Code

Solution code is available in the [solution-code](solution-code) folder.

## Deliverables

Your deliverable will be a Swift Playground containing your solutions.


### Bonus Activities

Bonus problems can be found at the bottom of the `contents.xcplayground` file in the [starter-code](starter-code).
