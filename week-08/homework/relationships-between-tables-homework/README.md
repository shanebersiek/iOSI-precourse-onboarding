## Exercise

This homework will give you more practice with using Joins on multiple tables in a database. Understanding relationships between tables, and being able to leverage those is an important part of using databases in your Android apps. Using the starter code, implement the requirements below.

#### Requirements

- Add at least four methods that do various Join operations of your choice on the data in the tables. You can change the data to be something else if you would like.
- Print out the results of your Join methods to the screen (either in TextViews or a ListView)

#### Starter code (if needed)

The starter code provided is from the lesson. Write your own methods in the Helper, and call them from the Activity.

#### Deliverable

An app that meets the requirements above.
