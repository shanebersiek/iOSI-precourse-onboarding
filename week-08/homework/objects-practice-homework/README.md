> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you should be able to to design a complex system of classes and define how they interact.

#### Requirements

- Create skeleton model classes (with no variables or methods) needed to build a local Git client. This should include: Commit. Branch. Tag. Author. File.
- Add state (variables) and behavior (method signatures, but not implementations) sufficient to:
 - Create a commit
 - Create a branch

 Use your Git client of choice to help define what your classes, methods and state look like. What kinds of properties does a Branch have? What about a Commit? Spend a few minutes digging through your Git client to try and figure out how these concepts interact with each other, then begin the exercise.

 You should not be concerned with things like file system access, we're purely interested in the interaction of your classes during creation of commits and branches.

**Bonus:**

- Add state and behavior sufficient to merge and delete branches.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](/starter-code). This consists of an empty playground. Your task is to add classes to the above specificiation to the playground.

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the playground in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

Your playground should meet all of the specifications described, and [will be evaluated by the following rubric](/rubric.md). Your code does not need to compile, as we aren't focusing on implementations, just interactoin between classes. This homework's assessment will be based on the functionality, cleanliness and simplicity of your OOP design. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code (once posted).
