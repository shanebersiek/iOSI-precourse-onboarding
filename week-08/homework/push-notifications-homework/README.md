> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you should be able to add local notification functionality to an existing app, and understand how to interact with notifications when the app is started by 'swiping into' them.

#### Requirements

- Given a skeleton reminder app with a 'reminder' text box and a 'duration' text box, add a local notification that displays the 'reminder' text after 'duration' amount of	 time (seconds).
- If the local notification is 'swiped into', the app should display an alert with that text after it is opened.

**Bonus:**

- When the local notification is 'swiped into', the app should present a full screen view controller that displays the notification content (the text and duration of the notification).

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](starter-code). This consists of an application as described above. Your task is to add local push notification functionality to the app.

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the project in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

Your edited project should meet all of the specifications described, and [will be evaluated by the following rubric](/rubric.md). Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code (once posted).
