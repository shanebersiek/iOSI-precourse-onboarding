## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Finish working on your list of features that you are planning to build out for your final project, if you have not completed them in the previous class. The goal is to be able to distill your vision for what will be in your project.

With your team, you will create a project proposal that ties together everything that you’ve learned and defines your vision for your third project. Use your user goals and feature prioritization to construct a project proposal that distills down your point of view and outlines how you intend to complete your final project.

Create a deck that outlines your team's vision for your third project. How can you meet user needs while also providing a unique vision, based on what users value and what’s happening in the competitive space?

In the last 30 minutes of class, we will divide the groups and each group will present to one instructor (having the deck on your laptop is fine). Each group will have 7 minutes to present.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Take one hour to create a project proposal that answers the following questions:

- What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?
- What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings? Briefly recap what you learned
- Who is your target audience?
- What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen.
- How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?
- Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
- Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you’re proposing?

Use easy to understand language and avoid too much insider terminology.  

Consider giving each group member 1-3 slides to work on so you can combine your efforts; also, be sure to tap into your work from earlier today and yesterday - research plan, personas, prioritization.


#### Deliverable

Create a presentation deck - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 7 slides that answers the questions above. Include images, if appropriate.
