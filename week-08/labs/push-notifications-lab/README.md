## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice setting up and using Push Notifications using Firebase.

> ***Note:*** _This lab can be done in pairs._


#### Why we are doing it

The first few iterations of the iPhone did not have Push Notifications. People were upset about that, but Apple was really keen on doing it correctly, taking care not to waste too much battery.

Apple Push Notification (APN) was the solution. It allows apps to alert their users when something interesting happens. Knowing how to setup and use Push  Notifications enhances the connection between the user and your apps.

## Exercise

Let's make a Yo app, a really simple app with a 'YO!' button. When the button is tapped, all users get a push notification with the word "Yo!".


**NOTE:** Push Notification only work on real devices and not with Simulators.  You will need a real device to complete this lab, so try to work with someone who has an Apple device, if you don't, and with someone who does't, if you do.

### Requirements

+ Use Firebase to make your life easier

+ When the button is tapped, all users get notified


**Verify that:**

+ You app does not crash
+ You used Firebase
+ The app works on different devices

## Deliverables

Turn in your XCode project.


### Bonus Activities

+ Obtain the user's device name and include it in the "Yo" message

+ Allow the user to send their own message with the "Yo" button

+ Add more buttons:
    + "WATTUP"
    + "WHAT'S SHAKIN"
    + "PASS IT AROUND"
