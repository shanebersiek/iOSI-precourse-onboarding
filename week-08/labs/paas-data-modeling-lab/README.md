## Introduction

#### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice using Firebase to build connected Apps.

> ***Note:*** _This lab can be done collaboratively or independently._


#### Why we are doing it

PaaS stands for Platform-as-a-Service, and describes a system that makes it simple to deploy server-side code.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we will rehearse building a data model to be stored on a server and consumed in an app.

Build a sample restaurant reviews app, using Firebase as your Database.


### Requirements

+ Design a data model around Restaurants, Reviews, and Users who can author Reviews

+ Determine what fields should be used for each model (e.g. name, rating, etc.)

+ Determine the has-many, has-one relationships between the model instances

+ Build the models in Firebase

+ Build the corresponding classes in the app

+ Build an app that shows a list of of each model

+ Design the view hierarchy in a Storyboard

+ Determine whether Reviews should be children of Restaurants or Users or neither, in both contexts, in Firebase and in the app

+ List the pros and cons of each approach you consider

+ Discuss the relationship between the data model structure and the view structure of the app. (i.e. Do reviews only appear on Restaurant pages or User pages or both?)

### Starter code

There is no starter code for this lab.

### Solution Code

There is no solution code for this lab.

## Deliverables

In a pull request, turn in your data model in a readme file along with an explanation of why you designed it the way you did. Also, submit your application.
