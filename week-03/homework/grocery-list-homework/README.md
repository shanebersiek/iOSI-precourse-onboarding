> ***Note:*** _This homework should be done independently._

## Exercise

By the end of this exercise, you will have created a fully functional grocery list app that tracks groceries to be purchased.

#### Requirements

- The app home screen should display a list of groceries to purchase. This should start off empty when you open the app.
- The app home screen should have a header view to add a new grocery to purchase
- The header view should consist of a screen of listable groceries (each of which has a name and an image).
- When you tap on a grocery that grocery is added to the list.
  - Required items (images of these are in the starter-code folder):
  - Banana
  - Apple
  - Orange
  - Milk
  - Cereal
  - Bread
  - Cheese
- After tapping on a grocery in the 'add' screen, the user should be taken back to the home screen and see the newly added grocery item in their list of groceries to purchase.
- The app home screen should display the quantity of each grocery to purchase. If you add one more of a grocery, the count should go up.

**Bonus:**
- The app home screen should let you modify the quantity of each grocery to purchase on the home screen.
- The app should let you remove a grocery from the list.
- The app should let you tap on a grocery in your list to see a full screen image of it. You should be able to navigate back from the full screen image.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](starter-code). This consists of a series of images for the required groceries. You are required to create your grocery app from scratch.

#### Deliverable

Your deliverable is a complete app hosted in your local repository. When finished, submit a pull request to your course repository.

#### Assessment

The contained app should meet as many of the above specifications as possible. Don't worry about graphics or additional features. Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code
