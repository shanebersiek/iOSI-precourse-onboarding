## Introduction

### What we are doing

In this lab, we will create and experiment with Xcode Playgrounds and take our first foray into writing Swift Code.

> ***Note:*** _This Lab is designed to be done independently._


### Why we are doing it

Xcode Playgrounds allows you to write and test code quickly and cheaply. This is valuable when you want to learn how to use a new Library, Framework, or Swift feature without having to create an entire App.


## Exercise

### Requirements

+ Create a new Playgrounds Project in Xcode

+ Say something about yourself using the `print()` command

+ List and print what languages you know (Human or Computer)

+ Print a quote from your favorite movie

+ Write code that takes the average temperature of the last 5 days in your hometown

+ Solve the following math problems in Swift:
    + Heather drove at a constant speed and traveled 182.4 miles in 3 hours. How many miles would Heather travel in a week at the same speed?
    + Yei is a cashier. She can ring up 12 customers in 20 minutes. At this rate, how long would it take for her to ring up 1000 customers?
    + Every day, a group of 9 workers picks pea pods in a field. Each worker picks 2400 pea pods, and each pea pod contains 6 peas. How many peas do the workers pick every day?


### Starter code
There is no starter code provided for this Lab.


### Solution Code
Solution code can be found in [solution-code](solution-code).

### Bonus Activities

+ Show a profile picture of yourself, using a `UIImageView`
>Hint: You can use `from(link: "link")` to convert a URL directly into a `UIImageView`

+ Show a picture of your favorite place, using a `UIImageView`

+ Show a picture of each planet, including Earth using a `UIImageView`

+ Write code checking whether all other 7 planets can fit between the Earth and the Moon
>![Planets fitting between the earth and the moon](http://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/CLqdeKf.jpg)

    + Your code should print `"The Planets fit"` or `"The Planets do not fit"`

+ Calculate the standard deviation of the mass of the 8 planets.
