> ***Note:*** _This is a group exercise._

Practice using Developer Documentation to find answers to problems you encounter! This lab is broken into **3** group assignments. The first will have you use elements from `UIKit`. Next, you'll practice asking and answering questions that others will be able to understand. Finally, you'll learn a new class in Swift and developer documentation to teach yourself the `UISwitch`!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

This lab is broken into four parts:

**Properly Asking for Help (20 minutes)**

- Register for a [**Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/) account
- Fill out your Stack Overflow profile details with as much detail as possible
- In a group, use developer documentation to research the `UIImageView`, `UIButton`, `UILabel` classes
- Write down questions you have on the table
- Review the contents of [Stack Overflow's 'How do I ask a good question?'](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- Come up with a question to help you answer the problem you and your group has run into and review your group's question to verify it's as clear as possible
- Post the question in Slack

> ***Next***: Once every group has posted a question online, move to the next section.

**Answering Questions (20 Minutes)**

Everyone, as a class, should review the questions that other students have posted:

- Your instructor will assign one question to each group
- You have 10 minutes to research, using the official Swift docs and the other online forums, and try to answer the question you've been assigned
- Bonus: Answer other students' questions than the one your were assigned!

**Stack Overflow (15 minutes)**

In the past week, you have likely run into a problem:

- Brainstorm common problems or errors that you and your group mates have encountered so far in class
- Research them on Stack Overflow
- Upvote answers and comments that you find helpful or insightful
- Once you've completed this, it is time for you to learn something _new_ again!
- Research the `UISwitch` class
- `UISwift` is an element of `UIKit` designed to allow the user to flip a switch! For example, in the Settings app you use a switch when you turn on Airplane Mode, or when you use bluetooth.
- _When_ you run into a problem, you should use documentation to aid you!
- **If** you find that you have a _unique_ question, **you should post it!**
- **Otherwise** feel free to comment and upvote answers that you find helpful!

**Wrap Up (5 minutes)**

- Ask questions! Let's get everything out.
- What hurt? What felt great?
- What was the largest takeaway for you from this exercise?

#### Starter code

No starter code for this one!

#### Deliverable

There should be questions on Slack from each group with answers from different groups!
