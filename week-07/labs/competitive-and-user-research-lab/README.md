## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This activity will be done in project 3 groups._

Now, it's time to break up into your teams for project three!

Each group has been contracted by a different client - New York Times, TouchLab, and Vice Media - to create an Android application that can feed people news stories!

For this lab, you will start your work towards your project pitch by doing competitive research and coming up with a research plan including questions for user research.  

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Once you're in your teams, you're going to do competitive research and create a spreadsheet comparing existing apps that feature a news feed. You should spend about 50 minutes on this portion of the lab.  

For your competitive research:

- Choose 5+ experiences or apps in your project’s industry or an adjacent industry, and analyze them
- As a team, choose one of the two formats covered (feature inventory vs. + / Δ), and work together to create a competitive analysis for your final project topic:

  - If you choose choose feature inventory focus on this question: What features do they offer?
  - If you choose + / Δ, focus on these questions: What does each do well? What does each do poorly?

After you're finished with your competitive research, for the remainder of the lab, you're going to come up with a research plan using the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf). Write a short research plan for your final project that answers the following:

  - What area(s) are you interested in researching?
  - What are your research goals? What are you trying to learn about your topic?
  - Who is your target audience? How will you find them?

> Instructor note: Instructor should walk around the classroom to check in on people’s research plans.

- Also, write a script for your final project topic that answers the following:

  - What can you ask about that will help you get at those research goals?
  - Write a list of topics you want to ask about. Then, write questions that correspond to each of those topics.
  - Make sure you’re not leading or biasing the questions.


#### Starter assets

Be sure to use the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf) for your research plan.

For the competitive analysis, create a blank Google Sheet and fill out your columns/rows as needed.

#### Deliverable

For the research plan with user research questions, you should have a completed the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf).

The competitive analysis should look something like this, depending on what method you choose:
