## Exercise

By the end of this homework, you should be able to create scrollable views laid out using auto layout.

#### Requirements

- Create an image viewer app which vertically scrolls through a fixed-size series of UIImageViews aligned using auto layout. Do not use a UITableView or UICollectionView.
- When an image is tapped, transition to a full screen image view. The underlying image is larger than the screen, so make it scrollable (but not zoomable)

**Bonus:**

- Adjust your image viewer to scroll vertically and horizontally through an NxN grid of images (it's up to you how they're laid out), instead of a 1xN list of images.

#### Starter code

Here is the [starter code for this assignment](starter-code). This consists of a blank application and a series of images. Create the image viewer application as described above.

#### Deliverable

Fork this repository using Github, then clone your fork to your computer. Navigate to this folder. 
- Open the project in this folder, modify it as instructed above.
- Commit your changes to your fork and create a pull request. This is your homework submission.

#### Assessment

The contained app should meet as many of the above specifications as possible, [as defined in the rubric](/rubric.md). Still can't figure it out? Talk with your instructor and review the solution code.
